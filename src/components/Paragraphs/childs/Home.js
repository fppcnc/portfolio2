                <p>Hey There! </p>
                <p>I'm Filippo, a passionate Web Developer. With a background in culinary arts and a knack for
                    crafting the perfect pizza, I've ventured into the world of web development to create digital
                    experiences that are just as satisfying.</p>
                <p>My quest for excellence led me to Berlin, Germany, where I embarked on a new chapter of growth. From
                    my days as a head chef I began my retraining in the world of IT. This transformative journey marked a shift
                    from the world of gastronomy to the realm of coding.</p>
                <p>In my free time, you'll find me immersed in coding challenges, exploring new frameworks, and staying
                    connected with the developer community. I approach every project with enthusiasm, embracing
                    each challenge as an opportunity to grow and refine my skills.</p>
                <p>Beyond the screen, I find solace in the kitchen, experimenting with flavors, and perfecting my baking
                     â€” the timeless treasures that inspired my journey. Cooking and baking are my creative outlets,
                    and just as I blend diverse ingredients to create unforgettable dishes, I blend my skills to create
                    exceptional digital experiences.</p>
